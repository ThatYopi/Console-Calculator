# Console-Calculator
 My first project in C++. Might work on it more, might not.

 ### Here are a few notes about this project

 * As of now this project does not support any deicmal numbers so make sure to enter whole numbers only
 * Don't evnter anything other than numbers (e.g characters and letters) it will cause the whole program to break
 * The program does not repeat itself so if you want to use it again you have to close it, and open it again sadly
* And lastly I doubt anyone other than me is going to see this message but thank you for taking a look at my little crappy project :D
